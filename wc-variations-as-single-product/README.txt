Show variations as single product on shop, product category and search result page.

== Description ==

With the Variations as Single Product for WooCommerce plugin, you can simplify your product display by showing variations as individual products on the Shop page, Product Category page, and Search result page. This makes it easier for customers to find and purchase the exact variation they want without having to navigate to the single product page.

By default, WooCommerce groups all variants within a single variation product, requiring users to navigate to the single product page to choose a variation and add it to their cart. With this plugin, users can easily add variations directly from the Shop page, as it converts all variations into single products.
